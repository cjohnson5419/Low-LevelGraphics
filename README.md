# Low-LevelGraphics

For this project I decided to keep it the graphics to the lowest level of graphics 
and created a smilely face with a tongue out and nose. 

I used pygame to make points and circles, and to display the image. 

What I learned from this project is programming is like creating life in a machine. 
With a little time and a lot of effort, creating images from the bare bones can be a daughting task but you can create anything you want with programming. 

**Installation**
Download the file and run it in any IDE of your chose.
